                <aside class="quote"><q>When <strong>demotivation</strong> enters your life, you must explore and discover what it is that matters to you; <strong>motivation</strong> can only motivate you for a limited period of time.</q></aside>
                
                <!--First Paragraph-->
                <p>Are you a person who is motivated or someone who is committed? When creating something, it is critical to recognize the distinction between dedication and motivation. Motivation comes from beyond, however commitment comes from inside. Motivation is something from the outside that we allow to enter our minds. While dedication can only come from inside. Is there something wrong with it?
                    In the long run, if you are someone who is continuously seeking for inspiration, you may discover in your life that you will not or cannot achieve something without this incentive. You will become entangled in something that does not exist in your world. It's like a car, and motivation is the key; without it, the automobile would not move.
                    If you question yourself, are you the automobile that need a key or the car that starts itself? You definitely want to be the automobile that is completely under your control.
                    Do you wake up with complete control over yourself, or do you require drive merely to get out of bed? This is what exactly happen if you are a person who is always looking for motivation before to start doing something.</p>
