                <aside class="quote"><q>When <strong>demotivation</strong> enters your life, you must explore and discover what it is that matters to you; <strong>motivation</strong> can only motivate you for a limited period of time.</q></aside>
                
                <!--First Paragraph-->
                <p>Are you a person who is motivated or someone who is committed to building something important in your life? When creating something, it is critical to recognize the distinction between dedication and motivation. Motivation comes from your ideas of life, it maybe a ideology, belief or religion. However commitment comes from inside, it is only you and yourself. Motivation is something from the outside that we allow to enter our minds. While dedication can only come from inside.
                    Is there something wrong with it? <br>
                    In the long run, if you are someone who is continuously seeking for inspiration, you may discover in your life that you will not or cannot achieve something without this incentive. You will become entangled in something that does not exist in your world. It's like a car, and motivation is the key; without it, the automobile would not move.
                    If you question yourself, are you the automobile that need a key or the car that starts itself? You definitely want to be the automobile that is completely under your control.
                    Do you wake up with complete control over yourself, or do you require drive merely to get out of bed? This is what exactly happen if you are a person who is always looking for motivation before to start doing something.</p>

He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission.

In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.</p>

Such food, moreover, taxes our digestive organs decidedly less, and, in making us more contented and sociable, produces an amount of good difficult to estimate.</q>

To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine.</q>
